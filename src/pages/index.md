# Adobe Developer Documentation Block Reference

The Adobe Developer Documentation Block Reference provides a comprehensive catalog of reusable content blocks for building rich, interactive documentation experiences.

## Overview

This reference site showcases all available blocks that can be used to create engaging developer documentation. Each block is a modular component designed to present specific types of content, from hero banners and code examples to interactive API documentation and media resources.

These blocks provide a consistent, standardized way to structure and display content across Adobe developer documentation sites. Whether you're building tutorials, API references, or product guides, these blocks enable you to create professional, accessible documentation efficiently.

## Categories of Blocks

There are three main categories of blocks available:

* **Content Blocks**: Foundational layout and content presentation blocks including heroes, accordions, columns, tabs, and more. These blocks help organize and structure your documentation content.
* **Code Blocks**: Specialized blocks for displaying code snippets with syntax highlighting, language selection, line highlighting, and various formatting options.
* **API Documentation Blocks**: Interactive API reference blocks powered by Redocly, providing comprehensive API documentation with customizable layouts and configurations.
