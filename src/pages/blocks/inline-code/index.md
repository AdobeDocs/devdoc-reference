Colors in Adobe Express are created as instances of the [`Color`](https://stage--adp-devsite-stage--adobedocs.aem.page/express/add-ons/docs/references/document-sandbox/document-apis/interfaces/color) class: objects with `red`, `green`, `blue`, and `alpha` (optional) values in the range from 0 to 1. The `alpha` value represents the opacity of the color, with 0 being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque.
