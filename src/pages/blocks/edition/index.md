The Edition Block allows you to display edition-specific content or labels on your pages. This is useful when you need to indicate which platform or edition a particular feature or content belongs to.

There are 2 different variants:

- The [with link](edition-with-link.md) variant displays the edition as a clickable link.
- The [without link](edition-with-no-link.md) variant displays the edition as plain text.
