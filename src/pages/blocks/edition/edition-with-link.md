# Edition with Link Example

<Edition slot="text"/>

[Platform](https://www.adobe.io)



Use `slot` to identify the markdown content:

- `text` (required) - The edition text content with a link

When you include a link in the text slot, the Edition block will render it as a clickable element, allowing users to navigate to the specified URL.
