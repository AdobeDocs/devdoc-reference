The Accordion Block allows you to create collapsible content sections, making it easier to organize and present large amounts of information without overwhelming users. Accordion items can be expanded or collapsed individually, providing a clean and organized way to display content.

## Available Slots

Each `<AccordionItem>` can use the following slots:

- `heading` (required) - The title/header of the accordion item
- `text` (optional) - Body text content
- `table` (optional) - Table data
- `code` (optional) - Code blocks

## Variants

There are 2 different variants based on complexity:

- The [basic accordion](accordion-basic.md) variant for simple collapsible text sections, ideal for FAQs or simple content.
- The [accordion with table and code](accordion-with-table-and-code.md) variant for complex content including tables and code blocks, ideal for API documentation or detailed technical content.
